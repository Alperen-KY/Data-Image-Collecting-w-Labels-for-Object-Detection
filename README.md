# Data-Image-Collecting-w-Labels-for-Object-Detection

This project build for graduation thesis by Me. 笑笑

Whatever guys this project is an example of tflite, RPi, pydrive, data labelling, blabla...

In this project to collect data autonomous you shoul train your model a little bit. Then it is gonna collect all datas by it self. But first some steps u will have to be filtered and chosen datas manually. And train again your model with that datas. And then in time it is gonna get closer to perfection. This is just a demo.
In the future I'm gonna work on this project more. I'm planning to add self training attribute to it. 
I used ssd_mobilnet_v1 quantized model. U can work with any other models if you want. 

Then take a look and if you has a question U can leave a comment or send a mail, I'll return you.

Thanks to EdjeElectronics I profit his RPi tutorial in the first steps.

Thanks to Nicholas Renotte his tutorials helped me a lot.
